# DrivenDataPREPARE

This repository includes the code that I used for the PREPARE Challenge - Phase 2: Model Arena (Social Determinants Track). My final placement on the leaderboard was 22/125. While I didn't make it to the report arena, I am still hoping to hear back about my community code submission in the coming weeks.
